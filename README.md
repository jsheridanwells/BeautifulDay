# BeautifulDay

A web app for planning and tracking an ideal day


## Some Dev Usefulness...

### Color Scheme:

[MaterialPalette](https://codepen.io/jsheridanwells/pen/ExgQzRb)

### Required Dependencies

This is a Node.js Express application that uses MongoDb for persistence and Angular for the client. The following dependencies will need to be installed for local development:

- Node.js (Version 14 is ideal)

- The Angular CLI (Version 11)

- Typescript (Version 4)

- Concurrently (an npm tool for running different Node.js processes simultaneously)

- Docker Desktop. As well as testing container settings, we can run the MondoDb database through a Docker container instead of going through a local installation.

- MongoDb (optional)


### Configuration

An `.env` file will need to be created at the root of the project with the following settings:

```
APP_SECRET=<a secret to sign the app's JSON web tokens. This can be any string. Protect this.>

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<register the app in the Google Dev Console: https://console.developers.google.com/>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<get your Google secret. Protect this.>

BD_USER=<The application user for the database. DbOwner of the application database>
BD_PWD=<The application user password. Protect this.>
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=<The root user for the MongoDb Docker container. The DB can only be accessed with this account>
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PWD<The root user password. Protect this.>
DB_NAME=<The app database. 'beautifulDay' by default>
```

In Angular, `./client.src.environments/environment.ts` will need the following values updated:
```
export const environment = {
  googleClientId: '<Must match GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID in .env>',
  googleSessionStorageKey: 'Can be anything. Used to identify the authentication token that gets returned from Google and saved in sessionStorage',
  jwtKey: 'Can be anything. Used to identify the apps JSON web token that is saved to localStorage'
}
```
Note that these values are assumed to be insecure.

### Dev Scripts

Note, to 


The `package.json` contains the following scripts for this project's dev tasks:

 - `$ npm run clean` - Clean out the `./dist` directory before transpiling the Typescript files.
 
 - `$ npm run clean:db` - Remove all MongoDb artifacts from the `./data/db` directory. Note, this command will request to be run under `sudo` if the files were created through Docker.

 - `$ npm run cp:www` -  Copy the `./bin/www` Express.js entry file to the output directory. This file is otherwise ignored in the regular Typescript compilation.

 - `$ npm run cp:mongo` - Copy the MongoDb init files to the output directory. These files are needed for bootstrapping the database through Docker.
 
 - `$ npm run dev` - Run the project with local configurations. This process will run `ng build --watch` for client-side scripts, `tsc -p [â€¦config] --watch` for application files, then it will run Nodemon to watch and restart the Express.js application. Note, there's some code in `app.ts` to refresh the browser whenever client-side code is updated, but sometimes this can lead to wonky performance. Comment it out if it' giving you grief.
 
 - `$ npm run prod` - Runs the project as above, but with production configurations. 
 
 - `$ npm run build:all` - Compile all source code and files to './dist' for direct deployment.
 -
 - `$ npm run build:img` - compile all source code and files to './dist' for Docker container deployment.

 - Use: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev-yml up --force-recreate` to run the MongoDb database in a Docker container. See the __configuration__ section above for the required environment variables.
